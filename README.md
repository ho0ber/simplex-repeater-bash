# simplex-repeater-bash
A simple simplex repeater controlled for ham radio enthusiasts using bash and a slew of other programs tied together.

This is meant to be a relatively simple script with plenty of comments so people can edit it easily to suit their needs.

See the notes in [the shell script](https://github.com/howtophil/simplex-repeater-bash/blob/master/simplex.sh) for more information.
