# simplex-repeater-bash
A simple simplex repeater controller for ham radio enthusiasts using bash and a slew of other programs tied together. Should work on Raspberry Pi or any other Linux computer. I have tested it on Lubuntu, Raspberry Pi 0, and an old netbook with a low-memory Linux distro installed. All work fine. A USB sound card can help with "buzzing" (ground loop) issues. If that fails, "ground loop isolators" for the 3.5mm sound leads can help.

Requires: A Linux computer (Pi or old laptop or whatever), an "APRS" cable, a Y-splitter, a ham radio, and a ham radio license. (More specific software requirements are in the shell script comments).

This is meant to be a relatively simple script with plenty of comments so people can edit it easily to suit their needs.

See the notes in [the shell script](https://github.com/howtophil/simplex-repeater-bash/blob/master/simplex.sh) for more information.
